# Privacy Policy
*Last updated: Dec 30, 2023*
<br />
<br />
This privacy policy for Crimson CarShare ("we," "us," or "our"), describes how and
why we might collect, store, use, and/or share ("process") your information when you
use our services ("Services"), such as when you:
<br/>
 - Visit our website at [crimson-carshare.live](), or any website of ours that
links to this privacy policy
- Engage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or
events
<br/>
**Questions or concerns?** Reading this privacy policy will help you understand your
privacy rights and choices. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please
do not use our Services.

## 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register
on the Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products
and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when
you contact us.
<br/>

**Personal Information Provided by You.** The personal information that we collect
depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you
make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect
may include the following:
<br/>
 - names
 - profile pictures
 - phone numbers
 - email addresses
 - contact or authentication data

<br/>
**Third Party Service Login Data.** We provide you with the option to register with us
using an existing third party provider: Google. If you choose to register in this way, we will collect the
information described in the section called "HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL
LOGINS?" below.
<br/>
All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate,
and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

## 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on
how you interact with our Services, including:
<br/>
- **To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage
user accounts.** We may process your information so you can create and log
in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.
- **To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.** We may process
your information to provide you with the requested service.
- **To enable user-to-user communications.** We may process your information
if you choose to use any of our offerings that allow for communication with
another user.

## 3. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?
Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social
media account details (namely your Google Account). Where you choose to do
this, we will receive certain profile information about you from Google. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the profile
concerned, but will often include your name, email address, and
profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make publicly available.
We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this
privacy policy or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.
Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your
personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that
you review their privacy policy to understand how they collect, use, and share your
personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites
and apps.

## 4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or
permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose
in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
period of time in which users have an account with us.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not
possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
Services within a secure environment.

## 6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
**Withdrawing your consent:** If we are relying on your consent to process your
personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on
the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can
withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY?"
below.
<br />
However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before
its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your
personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
consent.
<br />
**Account Information:** If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or
terminate your account, you can contact us with a deletion request. Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your
account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some
information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
requirements.

**CCPA Privacy Notice**
<br/>
This section applies only to California residents. Under the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA), you have the rights listed below.
<br/>
The California Code of Regulations defines a "residents" as:
<br/>
- (1) every individual who is in the State of California for other than a temporary or
transitory purpose and
- (2) every individual who is domiciled in the State of California who is outside the
State of California for a temporary or transitory purpose
<br/>
All other individuals are defined as "non-residents."
<br/>
If this definition of "resident" applies to you, we must adhere to certain rights and
obligations regarding your personal information
<br/>
**Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete.**
You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your
personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal
information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to)
the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance
requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be
required to protect against illegal activities.
<br/>
**Right to be informed — Request to know.** Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:
<br/>
 - whether we collect and use your personal information;
- the categories of personal information that we collect;
- the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;

the categories of personal information that we sold, shared, or disclosed for a
business purpose;
- the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold,
shared, or disclosed for a business purpose;

<br/>
**Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information:** We do not process consumer's sensitive personal information.
<br/>
**Verification Process:**
Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are
the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These
verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it
with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the
type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we
can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file,
or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that
you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as
the circumstances dictate.
<br/>
We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity
or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting
additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request
that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and
for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
information as soon as we finish verifying you.
<br/>
**Other Privacy Rights**

- You may object to the processing of your personal information.
- You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer
relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.

information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon

## AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS
We are Crimson CarShare ("Company," "we," "us," "our").  
<br />
We operate the website [crimson-carshare.live]() (the "Site"), as well as any other
related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "Legal
Terms") (collectively, the "Services").
<br />
These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you,
whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and Crimson CarShare,
concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing the
Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal
Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU
ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST
DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
<br />
Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the
Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to
these Legal Terms at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any
changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Legal Terms, and you waive
any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to
periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject
to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the
changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the
date such revised Legal Terms are posted.
<br />
The Services are intended for users who are at least 18 years old. Persons under the
age of 18 are not permitted to use or register for the Services.
<br />
We recommend that you print a copy of these Legal Terms for your records.

## 1. OUR SERVICES
The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to
or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or
use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any
registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those
persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent
local laws are applicable.
<br />
The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such
laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that
would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

whatsoever, without our express prior written permission.
<br />
